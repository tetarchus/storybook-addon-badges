import { Links } from '@site/src/components';

The standard way to specify badges is using a string in the `tags`/`badges` array:

```ts
tags: ['beta'],
// or
tags: [BADGE.BETA], // using the BADGE utility map
```

When used in this way, the value in the array (`'beta'` in the above example) is used to lookup the
definition in the {Links.BadgeMap}. If it finds a definition, it will use that to determine the
appearance of the badge, its content, and where it appears.

## Delimited Badges

Badges can also use a `delimiter` to split the badge up into its ID (used to lookup the definition
in the `badgeMap`), and its content (the text that is displayed on the badge).

The default delimiter is `':'`, but this can be overridden in:

- The {Links.BadgeMap} to apply to all badges unless overridden
- A [matcher](./matchers.mdx) to apply to badges found by the matcher

```ts
// With the default delimiter (':'), this badge:
tags: ['version:1.0.0']

// Would be turned into:
badgeId: 'version',
content: '1.0.0'
```

The `badgeId` portion is then used to lookup the badge's definition in the {Links.BadgeMap}. The
`content` part is then passed in to any [`BadgeFunction`](@todo), or displayed in a badge without a
`title` definition.

### Display Content Only

The `displayContentOnly` setting from the {Links.Addon}, [`BadgeConfig`](@todo), or
[`matcher`](./matchers) controls whether the `content` passed into [`BadgeFunction`](@todo)s
contains just the `content` portion, or the whole badge string.

In most cases, you won't need to touch this, unless you'd prefer that the badge displays the whole
string passed to `tags`/`badges` when using delimiters.

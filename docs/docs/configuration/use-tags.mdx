description: Use Storybook's built-in feature

import { Links } from '@site/src/components';

Storybook has a `tags` feature that has some overlap with badges, and allows you to define/use
badges that relate to things _other_ than just badges. See the Storybook page on [tags](@todo) for
more information on the built-in tags, use cases and more.

## Use Tags

From v3, tags are now enabled by default. If you'd prefer to revert to the v2 behavior and _not_ use
tags, you can pass `false` to the `useTags` option in your {Links.Addon}.

## Excluding Tags

If you'd like to prevent any tags that are created from showing as badges, you can use the
`excludeTags` option in the `badgesConfig`. By default, the tags that Storybook uses internally are
excluded (`['autodocs', 'dev', 'test', 'attached-mdx', 'unattached-mdx']`) as they are rarely useful
to display as badges and control the behavior of Storybook.

```ts
excludeTags: ['beta'],
```

If you supply your own value to `excludeTags` it will overwrite the default (as you may _want_ to
include some/all of these as badges). If you'd like to extend, you can use the `storybookTags`
export to spread into your custom array:

```ts
import { storybookTags } from 'storybook-addon-badges';

// In addons.setConfig/parameters
badgesConfig: {
  excludeTags: [...storybookTags, 'beta'];
}
```

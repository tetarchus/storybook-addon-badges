import { AvailableStyles, BadgeFunction, Links } from '@site/src/components';

The `baseStyle` property of the {Links.Addon} provides both the style for badges without an entry in
the {Links.BadgeMap}, and the fallback style for properties that aren't defined in badge configs.

In this way, it helps keep the styles consistent as you can define a `baseStyle`, and then just
change colours of each badge (although you can also have drastically different styles for each badge
if you wish!).

## Base Style Name

`storybook-addon-badges` offers `default` and `github` base styles by default. The `baseStyle`
option accepts either of these as basic string values if you wish to just use the built-in styles
with no changes (in fact for `default` you don't need to provide any value).

```ts
baseStyle: 'github',
```

## Extended Base Style

Alternatively you can pass in your own base style that extends one of the above. In this case,
`baseStyle` expects an object containing _some_ of the
[available styles](#available-style-properties). It also requires a `base` property which is a
string containing the name of a built-in style (`default` or `github`).

```ts
baseStyle: {
  base: 'github',
  borderRadius: '1px'
}
```

## Full Style

If you prefer to completely customise your `baseStyle`, you can provide an object containing _all_
of the [available properties](#available-style-properties). In this case, the `base` key is not
required, as all properties will have been overridden.

## Function

`baseStyle` also accepts a function that returns any of the above values (base style string,
extended base style, or a full style).

<BadgeFunction />

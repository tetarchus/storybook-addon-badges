title: Badge Map
description: Custom badge definitions

import { BadgeDefinition } from '@site/src/components';

The `badgeMap` holds all of your badge definitions. It's an object where the keys are badge IDs, and
the values are a `BadgeConfig` object containing the following properties:

## Badge Config

<BadgeDefinition />

## Badge Ordering

Badges are ordered by their `priority`, then alphabetically. By default, all badges have a default
priority of `99` to allow others to be sorted before and after easily.

The `priority` also dictates which badges can show in the [sidebar](./locations.mdx#sidebar) along
with the value of [`sidebarDisplayBadges`](./locations.mdx#sidebar-display-badges).

Autobadges are a feature that allows for adding badges that don't need to be defined in advance for
a story.

<Admonition type='info'>
  If you frequently run multiple Storybooks locally, please see [Running Multiple
  Storybooks](#running-multiple-storybooks) below.
</Admonition>

## Options

The `autobadges` configuration option accepts either an array of
[built-in autobadges](#array-config), or a function that returns an array of strings which should be
badges to add to a story.

<ParameterWarning />

### Array Config

To use the built-in autobadges, pass an array of the built-in autobadge names below to the
`autobadges` config option:

```ts title='.storybook/manager.ts'
import { addons } from '@storybook/addons';

addons.setConfig({
  // ...rest of config
  badgesConfig: {
    autobadges: ['new', 'a11y-fail']
  };
})
```

There are several autobadges that can be defined by default:

- `new` - Assigned when a new story has been added since the last time you loaded the Storybook.
- `updated` - Assigned when a story has had args/parameter changes since the last time you loaded
  the Storybook.
- `a11y-fail` - When using `storybook-addon-a11y`, this will be added for stories that have a11y
  violations.
- `a11y-pass` - When using `storybook-addon-a11y`, this will be added for stories that pass a11y
  checks with no violations.
- `a11y-check` - When using `storybook-addon-a11y`, this will be added for stories that have
  'incomplete' checks from the a11y addon, allowing you to review.

<Admonition type='note'>
  `storybook-addon-a11y` is currently having some changes made to incorporate with the experimental
  testing addon. At the moment, the autobadges relating to `a11y` checks can only be generated when
  you select a story (they will then persist until the next time that story is selected).
</Admonition>

### Function Config

A function can also be used to configure your own custom autobadges.

<AutobadgeFunction />

`isNew`, `isUpdated` and `a11yStatus` allow you to include logic to apply those built-in badges in
your custom logic (as a custom function replaces that array).

The `autobadges` function can return an array of any badge IDs (not just the built-in ones), so you
can define custom badges and use the function to assign any of them based on information about the
story.

#### Example

```ts
autobadges: (params: AutobadgesFnParameters) => {
  const badges: string[] = [];

  // Incorporate logic for built-in autobadges (optional)
  if (params.isNew) badges.push(BADGE.NEW);
  if (params.isUpdated) badges.push(BADGE.UPDATED);
  if (params.a11yStatus === 'pass') badges.push(BADGE.A11Y_PASS);
  if (params.a11yStatus === 'fail') badges.push(BADGE.A11Y_FAIL);
  if (params.a11yStatus === 'incomplete') badges.push(BADGE.A11Y_CHECK);

  // Add custom logic based on information about the story.
  if (params.entry.id.includes('input')) badges.push('form-input');

  return badges;
};
```

### Disabing Autobadges

If you don't want to use autobadges, you can pass `false` to the `autobadges` config item. This will
disable autobadges entirely.

### Additional Options

Autobadges offer some additional configuration options to tweak settings to your liking.

- `markAllAsReadOnDocsView`: (default `true`) Clicking on a component with a docs page will usually
  select the docs page. As this usually loads all stories on the docs page (at least if using
  [`autodocs`](https://storybook.js.org/docs/writing-docs/autodocs#set-up-automated-documentation)),
  all stories will be loaded and any `new`/`updated` badges will be removed (as those stories have
  now been 'read'). To disable this behavior, and require manually selecting a story to clear the
  badge, you can pass false to this option.

## Running Multiple Storybooks

Due to how this addon works with autobadges, running multiple storybooks on the same URL (e.g:
`localhost` in development) may mean that the `new`/`updated` badges display when switching between
them.

You can get around this by providing an `storybookId` in your manager config:

```ts title='.storybook/manager.ts'
import { addons } from '@storybook/addons';

addons.setConfig({
  storybookId: 'my-storybook',
});
```

This will ensure that the data is saved against a unique key (otherwise all storybooks will be saved
against the default key, and can then conflict with each other).

Matchers give another option to pick badges based on text in the `tags`/`badges` array. It can offer
additional mapping from multiple `tags` into a single badge.

## Matcher

A `Matcher` contains the following properties:

- `badge`: This can be defined in several ways:
  - A `badgeId` string that relates to a key in the {Links.BadgeMap}
  - An object containing:
    - `id`: The `badgeId` string that relates to a key in the {Links.BadgeMap}
    - `title`: A [string](../customisation/badge-content.mdx#title) or
      [function](../customisation/badge-content.mdx#title-function) to override the badge's normal
      `title` field when matched by this matcher.
  - A full [`Badge Config`](@todo)
- `delimiter`: The delimiter to use when matching the `badgeId` and `content` of the string.
- `displayContentOnly`: Whether the `content` portion of the badge should just be the part after the
  `delimiter`(`true`), or include the `badgeId` (`false`).
- `locations`: The [locations](./locations.mdx) that the badge can appear.
- `match`: [Patterns](#patterns) to match. This can be a single pattern or an array of patterns.
  Arrays must match _ALL_ of the patterns to be considered a match.

## Patterns

A pattern is used to check whether a matcher is applied to a badge from the `tags`/`badges` array. A
pattern can be:

- A `string` which must match the badge text exactly to be applied.
- A `RegExp` which must match the badge text to be applied.
- An object containing one, or both of:
  - `badgeId`: `string` or `RegExp` to match against the `badgeId` portion of the badge text.
  - `content`: `string` or `RegExp` to match against the `content` portion of the badge text.

```ts
match: "beta", // Will match a badge with the text 'beta',
match: [/^version/ui], // Will match any badge with text starting 'version'
match: [{badgeId: 'deprecated'}], // Will match any badge with text before the delimiter matching 'deprecated'
match: [{content: "1.0.0"}], // Will match any badge with text after the delimiter matching '1.0.0',
match: [{badgeId: /^ver/ui, content: /^1./ui}], // Will match any badge where the id portion starts with 'ver' and the content portion starts with '1.',
```

## Usage

Matchers allow you to define a single badge type in the {Links.BadgeMap}, and then map several
different entries in the `tags`/`badges` array to that definition. This can be useful if you're
using `tags` for something else, but want similar badges to display.

## Use Matcher Badge Fallback

By default, if matchers are defined and none match a badge string, no badge will be displayed as it
won't fall back to the standard functionality. This allows you to only display defined badges,
rather than falling back to displaying a default badge for those that are not defined. It also means
that standard functionality of matching strings to their badge IDs will not work without defining a
matcher.

If you'd prefer that in the case of no matches, it fell back to the standard functionality, you can
pass `useMatcherBadgeFallback: true` to the {Links.Addon}.

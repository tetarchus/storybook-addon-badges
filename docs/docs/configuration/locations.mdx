import { Links } from '@site/src/components';

There are several locations in the Storybook UI that badges can appear. You can have badges display
in any, or all of these locations, or even be dependent on the type of entry (e.g: docs vs story).

## Sidebar

The `sidebar` displays the names of your components and stories. It's also the only place that some
[entry types](#entry-types) are visible (`root`, `component`, and `group`).

### Sidebar Display Badges

As space is limited in the sidebar, it is suggested that only a limited number of badges have it
available as a location.

By default, all badges assigned to the `sidebar` location will be displayed, however if you'd prefer
that only _some_ are displayed, you can set the `sidebarDisplayBadges` property in the {Links.Addon}
to the number of badges to display next to an entry. This property also accepts the value `'all'`
(the default) which shows all badges assigned the `sidebar` location.

## Toolbar

The `toolbar` is the primary location that badges appear. It is located above `docs` and `story`
entries.

## Toolbar End

The `toolbar-end` is an additional location on the right end of the main `toolbar`. Badges
positioned here are usually to the right of the `full screen` button.

## Locations Option

### Addon

The `locations` key of the {Links.Addon} controls the default locations that badges can appear.

It can be:

- a simple array of location names to display all badges without an override in those locations:

```ts
locations: ['sidebar', 'toolbar'],
```

- a mapping object where the keys are location names, and the values are a single
  [entry type](#entry-types) name, an array of [entry types](#entry-types) that are available for
  that location, or a boolean to enable/disable for all entry types:

```ts
locations: {
  sidebar: 'component', // All entry types except `root` can be set
  toolbar: true,
  'toolbar-end': ['docs'],
}
```

### Badge Config

The `locations` key of a [`BadgeConfig`](./badge-map.mdx#badge-config) overrides the default
settings for that badge. This accepts the same options as the addon, and will apply for that
specific badge only. If the string array option is passed, the types of component that will display
this badge will be based on the

## Separators

You can control how separators appear in any part of the UI. They can be used to separate the badges
from other parts of the UI, and be used in-between badges if preferred.

The available options for displaying separators are:

- `after`: A separator is added after all badges, to separate the badges from the content after
  them.
- `before`: A separator is added before all badges, to separate the badges from the content before
  them.
- `wrap`: Separators display before and after badges.
- `between`: Separators are added between badges, but not at either end.
- `all`: Separators are added before, after and between all badges.
- `none`: No separators are added.

Separators can be controlled on a per-location basis, or a single setting for all locations.

```ts
separators: 'wrap',
// or
separators: {
  sidebar: 'none',
  toolbar: 'before',
  'toolbar-end': 'before',
}
```

## Entry Types

Storybook has a concept of `entries` which relate to the type of content an item in the sidebar
contains.

The entry types are:

- `root`: Root entries are essentially categories in the sidebar. They contain `components` and
  `groups` and are not selectable. This entry type is only visible in the `sidebar` and cannot
  display badges anywhere else.
- `group`: Group entries appear as folders in the sidebar by default (unless you've heavily modified
  your UI). They are a method of sub-categorisation and are not directly selectable as clicking a
  group will open the group). This entry type is only visible in the `sidebar` and cannot display
  badges anywhere else.
- `component`: Component entries contain the `docs` and `story` entries relating to a component.
  They are not directly selectable, and clicking a `component` will open its first `docs`/`story`
  entry. This entry type is only visible in the `sidebar` and cannot display badges anywhere else.
- `docs`: Docs entries contain the documentation for a component. They can be auto-generated with
  the `autodocs` tag, or written manually. This entry type can have badges in any location.
- `story`: Story entries contain the actual stories for a component. This entry type can have badges
  in any location.

# Add Badges

Adding badges is done using the [`parameters`](https://storybook.js.org/docs/api/parameters) feature of Storybook.

You can add badges to all stories globally, to a component's stories, or to an individual story.
{/* TODO: Uncomment once functionality is added. */}
{/* You can add badges to all stories globally, to a component's stories, to an individual story, or a mix of all 3. */}

The `badges` parameter accepts an array of strings relating to badge names. The may be any of the [pre-defined badges](./predefined-badges.mdx), [custom badges](../customisation/create-custom-badges.mdx), or any string which will inherit the [default styles](../customisation/adding-styles.mdx#available-style-properties) if not defined.


{/* TODO: Remove once functionality is added */}
:::danger
`storybook-addon-badges` can currently only read from a single set of parameters, As such, when you set badges on an individual story level, it'll override any other badges defined.

## Adding Badges Globally

To add badges to all stories that don't have their own badges applied, add the `badges` parameter to your `preview` file (this may be called `preview.js`, `preview.jsx`, `preview.ts` or `preview.tsx`).

```ts title=".storybook/preview.ts"
// Replace `[your-framework]` with the name of your framework
import type { Preview } from '@storybook/[your-framework]';

const preview: Preview = {
  //...other preview config
  parameters: {
    //...other parameters
    badges: ['beta']
  }
}

export default preview;
```

:::tip
You can pass an empty array into the parameters for individual stories to prevent global badges from showing.

## Adding Badges to a Component

To add badges to all of a component's stories, add the `badges` paramter to the `meta` default export of a story file:

```ts title="MyComponent.stories.ts"
// Replace your-framework with the name of your framework
import type { Meta } from '@storybook/your-framework';
 
import { MyComponent } from './MyComponent';
 
const meta = {
  title: 'Path/To/MyComponent',
  component: MyComponent,
  parameters: { 
    badges: ['beta'],
    //...other parameters
  },
} satisfies Meta<typeof MyComponent>;

type Story = StoryObj<typeof meta>;
 
export default meta;
```


## Adding Badges to an individual story

To add badges just for an individual story, add the `badges` parameter to that story's `parameters`:

```ts title="MyComponent.stories.ts"
//...meta from above snippet

const Default: Story = {
  args: {
    //...component props
  },
  parameters: {
    badges: ['beta']
  }
}

export { Default };
```

Any string that is passed to `tags`/`badges` will display as a badge, and use the
[`baseStyle`](../configuration/base-style.mdx) by default. To prevent all badges looking the same,
you can define your own custom badges, each with their own look.

To add a custom badge, it needs to be defined under the [`badgeMap`](../configuration/badge-map.mdx)
configuration options.

<BadgeDefinition />

<Admonition title='Using Preview Config/Parameters?' type='tip'>
Be aware that while `badgesConfig` can be defined at global, component, or story level, the badges
defined under `badgesMap` will only apply to the `badges` defined 'below' that level. It is
recommended to define the `badgesConfig` parameter at the global level for all badges to ensure
consistency.

This does not apply when adding the config to the {Links.StorybookManager} config file, as the
config is not extendable, and all badges should be defined at the global level.

## Using the `BADGE` map

`storybook-addon-badges` provides a `BADGE` export that allows using a pre-defined map of the badge
names to ensure only defined badges are used, and provide completion with typescript.

To allow extending the default `BADGE`, as well as usage within `js` files this is just a simple
object mapping a key to a string.

To provide your own map, you can either create your own object, or extend the existing one to make
use of the pre-defined badges.

```ts
import { BADGE } from 'storybook-addon-badges';

const BADGES = {
  ...BADGE,
  MY_CUSTOM_BADGE: 'MyCustomBadge',
};
```

import { AvailableStyles, BadgeFunction, Links } from '@site/src/components';

Badges will inherit the {Links.BaseStyle} by default, so any badges that either don't have an entry
in the {Links.BadgeMap}, or that don't define a `style` key in their definition, will have the same
look.

To define a custom style for each badge, so that they are easy to tell apart, pass in a `BadgeStyle`
object to its configuration in the {Links.BadgeMap}. This can be a partial style, and any values not
provided will fall back to the {Links.baseStyle} values.

The `style` property accepts either an inline [`BadgeStyle`](../getting-started/exports.mdx) object,
or a function that returns a [`BadgeStyle`](../getting-started/exports.mdx).

## Inline Style

An inline style object can contain any of the [available properties](#available-style-properties).
Any that are not provided will fall back to the values from {Links.BaseStyle}.

```ts
badgeMap: {
  MyCustomBadge: {
    title: 'My Custom Badge',
    styles: {
      backgroundColor: '#00C7AC',
      borderColor: 'red',
      color: '#FFFFFF'
    }
  }
},
```

## Style Function

A style function accepts a `BadgeFnParameters` object as its only parameter and returns a
[`BadgeStyle`](#available-style-properties). This can be used to adjust the style based on
information about the story it's being added to:

<BadgeFunction />

```ts
badgeMap: {
  MyCustomBadge: {
    title: 'My Custom Badge',
    styles: ({ entry }) => ({ backgroundColor: entry.type === 'story' ? '#00C7AC' : '#FFFFFF'});
  }
},
```

## Available Style Properties

The `BadgeStyle` object is a limited subset of CSS properties, if there are any you need simply
raise a
[feature request](https://github.com/tetarchus/storybook-addon-badges/issues/new?assignees=&labels=needs+triage%2Cfeature+request&projects=&template=feature_request.yml&title=%5BFeature%5D%3A+).

The available properties (and their values in the
[built-in styles](../configuration/base-style.mdx)) are:

<AvailableStyles />

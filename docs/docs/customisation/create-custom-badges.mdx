title: Create Custom Badges
---

Any string that is passed to the `badges` parameter will display as a badge, and will use the [`baseStyle`](./adding-styles.mdx). To prevent all badges looking the same, you can define your own custom badges, each with their own look.

To add a custom badge, it needs to be defined under the `badgesConfig.badgeMap` parameter. This parameter expects an object with a key of the badge ID, and a configuration object with the following keys:

| Key        | Type              | Description                                                                            |
| ---------- | ----------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | 
| `location` | `BadgeLocation[]` | An array of badge [locations](./badge-locations.mdx) that the badge should appear.     |
| `styles`   | `BadgeStyle`      | An object containing the [style](./adding-styles.mdx) for the badge.                   |
| `title`    | `string`          | The text to display on the badge.                                                      |
| `tooltip`  | `TooltipConfig`   | Configuration for a [tooltip](./adding-tooltips.mdx) to display on hover of the badge. |

:::tip
Be aware that while `badgesConfig` can be defined at global, component, or story level, the badges defined under `badgesMap` will only apply to the `badges` defined 'below' that level. It is recommended to define the `badgesConfig` parameter at the global level for all badges to ensure consistency.
:::

## Example Config

To define a badge, simply add it under the `badgesConfig.badgeMap` key of your [parameters](https://storybook.js.org/docs/writing-stories/parameters). For the badge below, you can then display it in any story by passing `'MyCustomBadge'` to the `badges` parameter.

```ts
parameters: {
  //...other parameters
  badgesConfig: {
    badgeMap: {
      MyCustomBadge: {
        title: 'My Custom Badge',
        styles: {
          backgroundColor: "#FFCC00",
        }
      }
    }
  }
}
```

## Using the `BADGE` map

`storybook-addon-badges` provides a `BADGE` export that allows using a pre-defined map of the badge names to ensure only defined badges are used, and provide completion with typescript.

To allow extending the default `BADGE`, as well as usage within `js` files this is just a simple object mapping a key to a string.

To provide your own map, you can either create your own object, or extend the existing one to make use of the pre-defined badges.

```ts
import { BADGE } from 'storybook-addon-badges';

const BADGES = {
  ...BADGE,
  MY_CUSTOM_BADGE: 'MyCustomBadge'
}
```

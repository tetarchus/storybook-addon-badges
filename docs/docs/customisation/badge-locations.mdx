description: UI Locations that a badge can appear
---

Badges can appear in multiple locations within the Storybook UI. Current available locations are:

- `toolbar` - Display badges in the standard toolbar next to other controls.
- `toolbar-end` - Display badges at the end of the toolbar, to the right of the full-screen control.
- `sidebar` - Display badges in the sidebar next to the stories they apply to.

A badge definition can define multiple `locations` for a badge, and the default `locations` for all
badges to inherit can also be defined in the addon configuration.

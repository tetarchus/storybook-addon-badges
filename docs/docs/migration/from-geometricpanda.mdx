title: From `@geometricpanda/storybook-addon-badges`
description: Migrate from the OG
---

`storybook-addon-badges` began life as a personal clone
[`@geometricpanda/storybook-addon-badges`](https://github.com/geometricpanda/storybook-addon-badges)
when migration to Storybook v8 had seemingly stalled. As such, its configuration _began_ with the
same options, but these quickly became restrictive to add new options to the addon.

If you _do_ which to migrate however, it is possible to migrate from
`@geometricpandapanda/storybook-addon-badges` without doing anything other than
[installing](../getting-started/installation.mdx) this addon, and removing the old one.

For more powerful options/customisation however, it is suggested to migrate the `badgesConfig` of
`@geometricpandapanda/storybook-addon-badges` from the `preview` file, to the `manager` config (and
nest the existing map, which is the base level)
